# Prolog Family Assignment #

## What's here ##
Within this directory are 5 files.
1. `database.pl` : geneological database, where only child relations are defined.
2. `rules.pl` : predicates to determine various family relations.
3. `main.pl` : sanity script that outputs knowledge base in a neat format.
4. `family_tree.png` : the family tree visualized.
5. `output.txt` : output of `main.pl` just in case if it can't run.

## Learning Outcome ##
So this assignment is interesting mostly because of the new programming
language I have to use. Heck it ain't even a full programming language, as
its functionality is primitive compared to other more familiar ones like C, Java,
Python, etc. But with less functionalities mean that we have to find clever ways to
accomplish what we want, and it is very surprising how concise my code is
after I thought through the basic rules of satisfiability. I most likely won't
be using Prolog anytime again, but it is certainly an interesting language and
I have a special respect for those who have mastered it.

Having used Prolog, I think I can program prettier code by limiting myself with the
number of external libraries I am allowed to use. This way I am less relied on outside
sources and can fully utilize the power of the programming language I'm using.
